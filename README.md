 <b>xrdp-modern-login:<br /> An XRDP login screen with a clean, modern appearance and design.</b>

Created, tested and verified working on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS running on Hyper-V in Windows 10 Pro.

It's pretty simple. All we have here is the custom configuration options in xrdp.ini and a user-login.bmp to go along with it. Makes for a refreshing, universal, modern appearance to the XRDP login screen.

HOW TO INSTALL:
- Backup your original xrdp.ini by renaming it to xrdp.ini.bak (just in-case you need it later)
- Copy each file to their respective directories on your system<br /> (if you're running Ubuntu 18.04 on Hyper-V, you should be able to use the xrdp.ini file as-is)
- Reboot... and enjoy!
